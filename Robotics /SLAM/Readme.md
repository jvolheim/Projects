To run my code you first need to run the load_data.py code to transform the kinetics images into a pickle file. 
### main code running 

You can run the submission code by changing the dataset at the top and running each piece of the jupyter notebook or the provided .py file. 

Warning the code runtime is roughly 1h 20min to reduce this comment out the kenetic function calls as they take roughly 20min each. 

### ICP warmup 

To run the icpwarmup run the icp file inside the icpwarmup folder.
